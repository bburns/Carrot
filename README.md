Windows console navigation and other commands.

This is just a set of batch files I've found useful over the years. 

```
back      return to previous directory
beep      make a beep!
giti      view/edit .gitignore file
go        change to directory - use back to return
l         view directory contents
look      view directory contents
m         call more pager
read      call more pager
run       run a python program
setreg    set environment variable in current session and registry
settitle  set console titlebar to current directory
sys       bring up system properties dialog - click on envars to edit path
up        go up a directory
```
