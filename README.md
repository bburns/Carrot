Windows console navigation and other commands.

These are just some functions and aliases I've found useful over the years,
implemented as batch files for simplicity.


## Commands

### Navigation

```
go        change to directory - use back to return
back      return to previous directory
up        go up a directory
look      view directory contents
l         view directory contents
```

### Other

```

giti      view/edit .gitignore file
m         call more pager
read      call more pager
run       run a python program - remembers last program run
